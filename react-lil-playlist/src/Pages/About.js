                <p>Hi! Welcome!</p>
                <p>My name is Merel and I created this project for my studies Front End Development @Winc Academy.</p>
                <p>This is my first self-made Application using React and I am fairly proud of what I have accomplished so far! It took some time to let all the information sink in and make sense. But I feel I will love to keep using React for projects, because once you get the hang of it; it is very logical and clean coding. No coincidence I like to work organized, so me and React might be the perfect match ;)</p>
